      <h3>Headphones on. World off.</h3>
      <p>QuietComfort® 25 headphones are engineered 
to sound better, be more comfortable and 
easier to take with you. 
Put them on, and suddenly everything changes. 
Your music is deep, powerful and balanced, 
and so quiet that every note sounds clearer. 
Even air travel becomes enjoyable, 
as engine roar gently fades away. 
No matter how noisy the world is, 
it's just you and your music—or simply peace and quiet.</p>

            <h3>Better by design</h3>
            <p>We've designed our industry-leading headphones with higher-quality 
materialsa and finishes. They're lightweight, and earcups rotate even 
more for a better fit. The headband sits closer to your head, with 
luxurious suede-like material underneath for extra comfort. 
If the AAA battery runs out, you can still enjoy music without noise reduction.
And the earcups pivot to fit in a compact case that's easy to carry.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Less noise. More relaxing.</h3>
            <p>QC®25 headphones let you focus on what matters—your music, 
movies and videos. And they reduce what you don't want to hear. 
Like a crowded city street. Cabin noise inside an airplane. 
Or a busy office. Advanced noise reduction technology 
and unique electronics make it happen. 
Even the ear cushions give you an extra level of quiet by 
sealing out some of the world around you.</p>
          </li>
           <li>
            <h3>True-to-life sound</h3>
            <p>Many of our engineers are also musicians, with a passion for music. 
So when you wear these headphones, you'll hear ringing guitars. 
Soaring vocals as the chorus kicks in. Deep bass and 
crisp drums drive the beat forward. Bose® Active EQ 
and TriPort® technology deliver performance so compelling, 
you'll want to listen for hours. And the fit's designed so you can.</p>
          </li>
             <li>
            <h3>You're in control</h3>
            <p>The inline microphone/remote puts music and call controls at 
your fingertips. 
Many features are also compatible with today's most popular phones.</p>
          </li>
           <li>
            <h3>Your sound, your look</h3>
            <p>Declare your style by customizing your very own QC25 headphones. 
Whatever your inspiration—alma mater, sports team—the color 
combinations are virtually limitless and customized with ColorWare. 
Choose from 52 vibrant colors to customize 9 separate 
headphone elements in matte or gloss finish.
And rest assured, your customized QC25 headphones will look 
as good as they sound for years. 
They boast a durable finish with a great focus on detail. Superior painting 
techniques with automotive-grade paint have passed the toughest 
Bose environmental tests.</p>
